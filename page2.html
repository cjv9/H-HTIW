                    <h4>The Start of E-Commerce</h4>
            <p>Taken from ‘The True Story of the Internet- Dot Com Bubble Part 3’<br>
            <p>
                E-Commerce is arguably one of the Internet's key features, and started off with companies like Ebay and
                Amazon. Amazon, created by Jeff Bezos, was originally made to sell books, be a bookstore with the most titles. Ebay,
                created by Pierre Omidyar was an online auction site, where people could buy and sell anything they wished. Both of these creators
                saw the Internet as a business, and within months of launching sites, their businesses boomed. Amazon was soon selling
                thousands of books, as people took to ecommerce extremely easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Faster and cheaper computers were connecting and drawing in more users everyday, and thousands of people
                were buying and selling on the Internet, this promised a financial surge. Bezos pushed “get big fast”, and he lowered prices on
                Amazon whenever he could, sacrificing profit in order to gain more customers.
            </p>
            However, when credit card numbers started to be imputed, Amazon needed a way to protect this information. A
            new encryption method was born to secure sensitive information, public and private keys. With this new technology,
            Amazon was off to the races.
            </p>

            <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">
                <h4>Dot Coms and Stocks</h4>
        <p>
            Over at Ebay, Meg Whitman was hired to lead the company in a business sense, and with her at the helm,
            Ebay's IPO was successful. Amazon was soon predicted to double in its stocks by Wall Street Analysts, even
            if it was losing money. And when this prediction was announced, in a few short weeks, Amazons shares doubled,
            as investors ran to buy shares of any and every ‘.com’ company they could. This frenzy of buying stocks created
            Day Traders, who bought and sold stocks everyday, selling stocks to people who had neve before bought any kind of stocks.
            Soon, a huge amount of money was being poured into internet startups, ads, and stocks. Dozens of websites were created
            with no real ventures or purpose, and people were investing into them in a frenzy, hoping to luck out with their
            investments. The metaphorical bubble grew and grew.
        </p>

        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-white text-dark">
            <h4>The Pop</h4>
    <p>
        Telecommunications was another market that was being poured into by the millions. People flocked to invest in
        fiber optics, and to put them into the ground. However,
        there was no coordination between companies, investors, and owners, it was truly a frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wallstreet began to doubt how worthy these websites were, and then “Black Friday”, happened. NASDAQ fell by more
        than 25%, and so many investors lost so much money.
        In fact, the US Securities of Exchange Commission charged Henry Blodget, a Wall Street stocks analyst, with
        civil securities fraud, for recommending “.com” companies,
        even if he knew they were closed to worthless. The bubble popped.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even as all this money was lost, Amazon and Ebay prevailed, and revolutionized commerce as humanity knew it.
        They brought power to regular people, and allowed them to have
        some sort of power over companies, Amazon's ability to leave reviews is an example of that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies failed, jobs and money were lost, but those who survived genuinely transformed commerce.
